        <p className="mb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Incubate Nepal is an 8-week virtual program that connects students
          from all over Nepal to collaborate on open-ended projects. These
          students are matched with accomplished mentors as they navigate
          through their projects in small teams. Students will need to think
          creatively, deeply, and collaboratively as they write papers or
          prototype apps during the program. Mentors and guest speakers will
          also provide guidance on the US college admission process, as well as
          career advice in research and entrepreneurship. Incubate Nepal is
          completely free and available to students who have completed Grade 11
          or Grade 12, and not yet enrolled in university.
          <br />
          This program was founded by a group of MIT and Harvard graduates to
          make project-based learning more accessible to students in Nepal. In
          addition to connecting students from all over Nepal, this virtual
          program offers mentorship and exposure to open-ended projects.

        <p className="mb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Nepalingo is a project under Incubate Nepal. Since 1795, 61% of native
          languages across the world have already been lost, and many of
          Nepal&apos;s 100 indigenous languages have also been identified as at
          risk. Nepalingo.com aims to help preserve these languages and with
          them our stories, songs, history, and culture. We take the work of
          linguists who have already expended great efforts accumulating the
          knowledge of these languages into dictionaries and make that
          information easier to learn and remember. In doing so, we hope to help
          new generations connect with their elders and reconnect with their
          heritage.
